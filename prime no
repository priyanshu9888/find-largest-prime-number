 questions : Prime Number 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Which prime, below 100,000, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

Write a Python function which will take a number as an input parameter and print the largest prime number that is a sum of most consecutive primes.
